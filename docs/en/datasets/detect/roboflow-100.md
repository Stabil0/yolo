# Roboflow 100 Dataset

Roboflow 100, developed by [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=ultralytics) and sponsored by Intel, is a groundbreaking [object detection](../../tasks/detect.md) benchmark. It includes 100 diverse datasets sampled from over 90,000 public datasets. This benchmark is designed to test the adaptability of models to various domains, including healthcare, aerial imagery, and video games.

</p>

## Key Features

- Includes 100 datasets across seven domains: Aerial, Video games, Microscopic, Underwater, Documents, Electromagnetic, and Real World.
- The benchmark comprises 224,714 images across 805 classes, thanks to over 11,170 hours of labeling efforts.
- All images are resized to 640x640 pixels, with a focus on eliminating class ambiguity and filtering out underrepresented classes.
- Annotations include bounding boxes for objects, making it suitable for [training](../../modes/train.md) and evaluating object detection models.

## Dataset Structure

The Roboflow 100 dataset is organized into seven categories, each with a distinct set of datasets, images, and classes:

- **Aerial**: Consists of 7 datasets with a total of 9,683 images, covering 24 distinct classes.
- **Video Games**: Includes 7 datasets, featuring 11,579 images across 88 classes.
- **Microscopic**: Comprises 11 datasets with 13,378 images, spanning 28 classes.
- **Underwater**: Contains 5 datasets, encompassing 18,003 images in 39 classes.
- **Documents**: Consists of 8 datasets with 24,813 images, divided into 90 classes.
- **Electromagnetic**: Made up of 12 datasets, totaling 36,381 images in 41 classes.
- **Real World**: The largest category with 50 datasets, offering 110,615 images across 495 classes.

This structure enables a diverse and extensive testing ground for object detection models, reflecting real-world application scenarios.

## Applications

Roboflow 100 is invaluable for various applications related to computer vision and deep learning. Researchers and engineers can use this benchmark to:

- Evaluate the performance of object detection models in a multi-domain context.
- Test the adaptability of models to real-world scenarios beyond common object recognition.
- Benchmark the capabilities of object detection models across diverse datasets, including those in healthcare, aerial imagery, and video games.

## Dataset YAML

!!! note "Dataset Information"
    
    The Official Roboflow 100 dataset comprises 100 distinct datasets and can be accessed on both [GitHub](https://github.com/roboflow/roboflow-100-benchmark) and [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-100).

!!! tip "Ultralytics Support"

    We added support for the 100 most common classes drawn within the Roboflow 100 dataset collection.

A YAML file is used to specify the dataset configuration, including details such as the dataset's paths, classes, and other essential information. For the roboflow-100 dataset, you can find the `roboflow-100.yaml` at [https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/roboflow-100.yaml](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/roboflow-100.yaml).

!!! Example "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/roboflow-100.yaml"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "ultralytics/cfg/datasets/roboflow-100.yaml"
    ```

## Usage

To train a YOLOv8n model on the Roboflow 100 dataset for 100 epochs with an image size of 640, use the provided code snippets. For a comprehensive list of available arguments, refer to the model's [Training](../../modes/train.md) page.

!!! Example "Train Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

        # Train the model
        results = model.train(data='roboflow-100.yaml', epochs=100, imgsz=640)
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start training from a pretrained *.pt model
        yolo detect train data=roboflow-100.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=100 imgsz=640
        ```

!!! Example "Inference Example"

    === "Python"

        ```python
        from ultralytics import YOLO

        # Load a model
        model = YOLO('path/to/best.pt')  # load a brain-tumor fine-tuned model

        # Inference using the model
        results = model.predict("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
        ```

    === "CLI"

        ```bash
        # Start prediction with a finetuned *.pt model
        yolo detect predict model='path/to/best.pt' imgsz=640 source="https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg"
        ```
